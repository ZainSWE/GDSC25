                <p class="about-sub">GPYOU is a GPU recommendation tool designed to help users find the right graphics card based on their needs, preferences, and budget.

                    The graphics card market is constantly changing — dozens of models, confusing specifications, and 
                    widely varying prices make it difficult to know what to choose. GPYOU simplifies that process by 
                    asking you a few key questions, then offering personalized recommendations tailored to your situation.
                    <br><br>
                    Whether you’re building a new PC, upgrading an old system, or just trying to understand 
                    which GPU offers the best value for your use case, GPYOU helps you make an informed decision without the need for deep technical knowledge.
