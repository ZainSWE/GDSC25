            <p class="about-sub">GPYOU is a GPU recommendation tool designed to help users find the right graphics card based on their needs, preferences, and budget.

                The graphics card market is constantly changing — dozens of models, confusing specifications, and 
                widely varying prices make it difficult to know what to choose. GPYOU simplifies that process by 
                asking you a few key questions, then offering personalized recommendations tailored to your situation.
                <br><br>
                Whether you’re building a new PC, upgrading an old system, or just trying to understand 
                which GPU offers the best value for your use case, GPYOU helps you make an informed decision without the need for deep technical knowledge.
                <br><br>
                What GPYOU Offers:
                <br><br>
                A clean, user-friendly interface
                <br><br>
                Simple prompts to collect your use case (e.g. gaming, creative work, development)
                <br><br>
                Consideration for manufacturer preferences and price range
                <br><br>

                GPYOU is built for anyone — from first-time builders to experienced users — who wants clarity in a crowded market.
                 It’s not tied to specific brands or retailers, and it doesn’t rely on outdated benchmarks. The goal is simple: to
